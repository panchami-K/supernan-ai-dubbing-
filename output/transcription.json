So let us see how to save hygiene. The first step is to brush your teeth well before going to the booking in the morning. Clean your teeth, take bath, put deodorant, put a cloth. Why should you do all these? Because you are always around your child. Your child is very close to you. So if you smell from your body or mouth, children will not like it. They will fight with you if they do not come close to you. Or you can complain to your parents. So it is important to maintain hygiene. The second point is that you should always remember that you are going to the booking as a trained professional nanny. So you should look professional even in the clothes you wear. You can see here that the saree they are wearing does not look professional. They look like maids. So you are not a maid, you are going as a nanny. So if you wear the saree as much as you can, it will look good. Look at this, how neat it is. If you have a salwar or ID card, it looks good. So you will feel comfortable wearing this saree.

Then you should know where to wash your hands after putting your things there. Then you should wash your hands. You should wash your hands using soap or hand wash. If you do not wash your hands, then what will parents think? Parents will not be able to understand their children. They will start doubting whether they will be fit for this job. So do not forget to wash your hands.
